# Assignment-3

1) split each sequences into individual amino acids

2) make a dataframe; each column is an amino acid and each row is a sequence

3) perform pairwise comparison of two rows at a time (day 0 vs day 30) 

4) create dataframe from all the boolean series (for each pairwise comparison) and turn the booleans into 0 and 1 

5) get the column index which has lowest sum (as that amino acid column contains the highest pairwise false result/mutation)
